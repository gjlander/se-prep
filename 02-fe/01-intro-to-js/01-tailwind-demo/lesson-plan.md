# Tailwind Intro

- Why? It feels clunky at first, but once you get used to it, it becomes a huge time saver
- Plays especially well with things you'll learn later in the bootcamp
- I only ever write in vanilla CSS for the primer. I hated it for about 3 days,was fine for about another week, then after that could never go back.

## For now, simple plug'n'play with CDN

- Add cdn script tag in the head
- Note the Tailwind Preflight, has a more comprehensive CSS reset

## We'll disconnect the CSS file and recreate it in Tailwind

## Tailwind Intellisense

- Need extension, and empty tailwind.config.js file for it to work
- Gives us autocomplete, and tells us what CSS is being applied when we hover

## Tools for repeated styling

- Multi-line editing
- custom @ rules

## There's always more, but start small, just start to get familiar with the utility class names
