## Token Based Authentication (backend)

- Conceptually, we have introduced both Authentication and Authorization, but the practical focus today will be on Authentication
- Walk through authentication flow
- The nice thing is, you've already experienced this basic flow with the events API
  - We will be using a micro-services architecture, but the general flow will be similar

#### 1. Login Request

- Make a `POST` request to the `api/auth/login` endpoint
  - Remember the content in the body would be user input from a form

#### 2. Token Generation

- When the request is made, a token is generated on the server if the email/password match a user
  - or a forbidden error if they don't match
    - don't want to tell if it's email or password that was wrong - makes it easier for a potential hacker if they know which was right

#### 3. Token Sent

- With the events API, this is sent in the body of the response
  - Another option that we'll be exploring is sending the token in a cookie, but more on that soon
- The token contains information about the user (such as their id) we can use to authenticate their identity on later requests

#### 4. Subsequent requests

- In the context of Postman, we copy/paste the token, and add it to the headers
  - Remember with the actual project, this was stored in local storage, then retrieved and added to the headers
- Copy token and add to headers of `Get Profile`

#### 5. Token Validation

- Now with the token in the `Authorization` header, the server will validate the token (via a middleware)
- And when we send the request for user profile, we get the appropriate user
- But if the token is missing, or invalid, we get a forbidden error
- Other requests (such as creating or updating an event) also require this token

#### 6. Token Expiration

- Eventually this token would expire, requiring the user to sign in again, and revalidate their identity

## What is a token? (back to article)

- Go through section in article
- Follow JWT link, and copy/paste token into their site

### Signed Tokens vs Encrypted tokens

- Really important to note that we are using SIGNED tokens, not ENCRYPTED tokens
- This means, that you should not put ANY sensitive data in the payload
  - Even having the email here is questionable, the id would be enough
- What makes this actually secure is the signature part
  - The server has a secret that is added to the signature. By using this secret, you can be certain of the origin, and also be confident that it hasn't been tampered with
  - If this secret was somehow leaked, that would be a big security concern, and you would need to generate a new secret (which would also invalidate all current tokens)

## Microservices Architecture

- Unlike the events planner, we will use microservices. We will have a separate server purely dedicated to our auth logic, which can make it more scalable, etc. but also make it easier to potentially replace it with a more robust solution from a third-party library later. And since our auth operations aren't totally stateless, it allows our API layer to still conform to RESTful principles

## And how to implement it? (back to article)

- Go through rest of the article

# Auth server

- Most of our time and effort will be spent in the auth server, then we will simply add a middleware in the api to authenticate users

## Tour of the app

- We're still following our MVC model, so the structure will look the same as our API

### package.json

#### Dependencies

- bcrypt - a library to hash (encrypt) passwords, so we're not saving plain text passwords in the DB
- cookie-parser - we can remove this since we'll be sending the payload in the body of the response, and using Auth headers
- cors - stands for Cross Origin Resource Sharing. Since our API and our SPA are deployed separately, they have different origins. The cors library helps us do that securely, and prevent CORS errors
- jsonwebtoken - this is the library from Auth0 we'll use to sign and verify our JWT
- zod - needs to be moved from dev dependencies since we need it in production
- types libraries when needed to TS

### Config folder

- Previously, when working with .env files, we would simply import the variables as needed with `process.env`. Since we're working with quite a few env variables now that also need to fit certain requirements, we can use Zod to validate our env variables.
- We will also add on additional variable, for the length of our Access token
- Based on what we see here, we should end up with a `.env.development.local` file that looks something like this (using some default values from Zod)

```
MONGO_URI=<mongo_uri>
DB_NAME=travel-journal
ACCESS_JWT_SECRET=ce8dbacbb0459ba342690a48332595592e34203c1aa7c676faac43853ccac642
CLIENT_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5173
```

### Middleware

- Our Zod middleware looks the same
- Not found looks the same as well
- Error handler looks the same too, but we will make some updates as we go

### app.ts

- We have our usual setup, with a couple of extras

#### cors

- We use `cors` middleware to only allow requests from our frontend origin (localhost in dev, Render deployed site in production)
- credentials true means we can send/receive our secure cookies
- we also expose the header so we can trigger a refresh

## Database Models

- Based on our Zod user schema, we can make a pretty standard looking Mongoose model

```ts
import { Schema, model } from 'mongoose';

const userSchema = new Schema(
	{
		firstName: { type: String, required: [true, 'First name is required'] },
		lastName: { type: String, required: [true, 'Last name is required'] },
		email: {
			type: String,
			required: true,
			unique: true
		},
		password: {
			type: String,
			require: true
		},
		roles: {
			type: [String],
			default: ['user']
		}
	},
	{
		timestamps: { createdAt: true, updatedAt: false }
	}
);

const User = model('User', userSchema);

export default User;
```

- We'll circle back later to the `RefreshToken` model

## API Endpoints

### Register

- In the past this would be our `createUser` endpoint. Without taking into consideration the additional logic we'll need for authenticating, what needs to happen when we create a new user?
  - check if the email is registered (exists is faster than `findOne` since it only returns the \_id)

```ts
const userExists = await User.exists({ email });
if (userExists)
	throw new Error('Email already exists', { cause: { status: 409 } });
```

- create the user in the database

```ts
const user = await User.create({ email, password, firstName, lastName });
```

- send user in the response

```ts
res.status(201).json(user);
```

- Now we can register a user in Postman, just as we've done before. First problem to solve is that the password is saved in plain text

#### bcrypt

- Through a process called salting and hashing, we can encrypt the user password so keep it secure
- We import it

```ts
import bcrypt from 'bcrypt';
```

- We generate a salt for it, and then hash it, and save the hashed password to the DB

```ts
const salt = await bcrypt.genSalt(SALT_ROUNDS);
const hashedPW = await bcrypt.hash(password, salt);

const user = await User.create({
	email,
	password: hashedPW,
	firstName,
	lastName
});

res.status(201).json(user);
```

- Now when we save a user, their password is safe against potential leaks
- I will keep our `User` router, and start migrating functionality to our `auth` routes as they come up

#### Respond with payload instead of new user

- Now instead of sending the newly made user in the response, we want to generate a cookie that will hold the JWT access token
- import it into `auth.ts`

```js
import jwt from 'jsonwebtoken';
```

- Everything up until `User.create` will stay the same

#### Sign the JWT token

To sign the token we need 3 things

1. the payload (the actual data we send)
   - We will send the user's roles
2. the secret, for that let's make an env variable
3. token options, where we'll set the expiration date, and include the subject (our user's id)

```js
const payload = { roles: user.roles };
const secret = ACCESS_JWT_SECRET;
const tokenOptions = {
	expiresIn: ACCESS_TOKEN_TTL,
	subject: user._id.toString()
};
```

- Then we call the `sign` method on `jwt`

```js
const accessToken = jwt.sign(payload, secret, tokenOptions);
```

#### Adding accessToken to response body

- Since we'll be saving our tokens in localstorage, we simply add it to the response body

```ts
// send the new tokens in the response
res.status(201).json({ message: 'Registered', accessToken });
```

- Now if we test the endpoint, we see our welcome message and the tokens
- And if we check Mongo Compass we see our new user
- We'll have to manually add it to auth headers, but later we'll do that programmatically

### Managing the Refresh token

- In addition to the short-lived access token, we will save a refresh token in the DB. This is where we add a splash of session management. This is what will allow for a `remember me` type option, where the user can stay signed in on a device for a longer time

#### RefreshToken Model

- In the model, we'll save the token itself, the userId associated with it, and an expiration date

```ts
import { Schema, model } from 'mongoose';
import { REFRESH_TOKEN_TTL } from '#config';

const refreshTokenSchema = new Schema(
	{
		token: {
			type: String,
			required: true,
			unique: true
		},
		userId: {
			type: Schema.Types.ObjectId,
			required: true,
			ref: 'User'
		},
		expireAt: {
			type: Date,
			default: () => new Date(Date.now() + REFRESH_TOKEN_TTL * 1000)
		}
	},
	{
		timestamps: { createdAt: true, updatedAt: false }
	}
);

const RefreshToken = model('RefreshToken', refreshTokenSchema);

export default RefreshToken;
```

- Indexing a property is a way to speed up read queries (at the cost of slowing down write queries), but we can also use it in conjunction with the `expireAt` field to have it automatically be deleted after the time designated

```ts
// Creates a TTL (Time-To-Live) Index. Document will be removed automatically after <REFRESH_TOKEN_TTL> seconds.
refreshTokenSchema.index({ expireAt: 1 }, { expireAfterSeconds: 0 });

refreshTokenSchema.index({ userId: 1 });
```

#### Create Refresh token and add to res sbody

- We can just use `randomUUID` to generate a random token for us, then save it to the DB

```ts
import { randomUUID } from 'node:crypto';
import { User, RefreshToken } from '#models';
//other stuff...

// refresh token
const refreshToken = randomUUID();

await RefreshToken.create({
	token: refreshToken,
	userId: user._id
});
```

- We then add it in the body of the response

```ts
res.status(201).json({ message: 'Registered', refreshToken, accessToken });
```

### Creating utility functions

- Our register controller is starting to get a bit long, but more importantly, everything we're doing to create the refresh and access tokens, along with setting the cookies will need to be repeated in our `login` endpoint. Let's extract the logic for each into some utility functions, so we can reuse that logic
- First we need to create a `utils` folders and add it to imports

#### createTokens util

- Let's have one function generate both tokens, since we'll need both anytime we make them
- We will also need our imports, and to pass then user data as an argument

```ts
import jwt from 'jsonwebtoken';
import { ACCESS_JWT_SECRET, ACCESS_TOKEN_TTL } from '#config';
import type { Types } from 'mongoose';

const createTokens = async (userData: {
	roles: string[];
	_id: Types.ObjectId;
}) => {
	// access token
	const payload = { roles: userData.roles };
	const secret = ACCESS_JWT_SECRET;
	const tokenOptions = {
		expiresIn: ACCESS_TOKEN_TTL,
		subject: userData._id.toString()
	};

	const accessToken = jwt.sign(payload, secret, tokenOptions);
};

export { createTokens };
```

- Then we create the refresh token, and return them as a tuple

```ts
import { randomUUID } from 'node:crypto';
import jwt from 'jsonwebtoken';
import { ACCESS_JWT_SECRET, ACCESS_TOKEN_TTL } from '#config';
import { RefreshToken } from '#models';
import type { Types } from 'mongoose';

type UserData = {
	roles: string[];
	_id: Types.ObjectId;
};

const createTokens = async (userData: UserData): Promise<[string, string]> => {
	// refresh token
	const refreshToken = randomUUID();

	await RefreshToken.create({
		token: refreshToken,
		userId: userData._id
	});

	// access token
	const payload = { roles: userData.roles };
	const secret = ACCESS_JWT_SECRET;
	const tokenOptions = {
		expiresIn: ACCESS_TOKEN_TTL,
		subject: userData._id.toString()
	};

	const accessToken = jwt.sign(payload, secret, tokenOptions);

	return [refreshToken, accessToken];
};

export { createTokens };
```

## Doing the same in our `login` endpoint

```ts
export const login: RequestHandler<{}, TokenResBody, LoginDTO> = async (
	req,
	res
) => {
	// get email and password from request body
	const { email, password } = req.body;

	// query the DB to find user with that email
	const user = await User.findOne({ email }).lean();

	// if not user is found, throw a 401 error and indicate invalid credentials
	if (!user)
		throw new Error('Incorrect credentials', { cause: { status: 401 } });

	// compare the password to the hashed password in the DB with bcrypt
	const match = await bcrypt.compare(password, user.password);

	// if match is false, throw a 401 error and indicate invalid credentials
	if (!match)
		throw new Error('Incorrect credentials', { cause: { status: 401 } });

	// delete all Refresh Tokens in DB where userId is equal to _id of user
	await RefreshToken.deleteMany({ userId: user._id });

	// create new tokens with util function
	const [refreshToken, accessToken] = await createTokens(user);

	// set auth cookies with util function
	// setAuthCookies(res, refreshToken, accessToken);

	// send generic success response in body of response
	res.status(200).json({ message: 'Logged in', refreshToken, accessToken });
};
```

## Let's skip ahead to `me`

- We have to access the header
- It comes as a string, we can split to just get the token without `Bearer`

```ts
export const me: RequestHandler<{}, MeResBody> = async (req, res, next) => {
	// get accessToken from request cookies
	// const { accessToken } = req.cookies;
	const authHeader = req.header('authorization');
	console.log('authHeader:', authHeader);

	const accessToken = authHeader && authHeader.split(' ')[1];

	// if there is no access token throw a 401 error with an appropriate message
	if (!accessToken)
		throw new Error('Access token is required.', { cause: { status: 401 } });

	try {
		// verify the access token
		const decoded = jwt.verify(
			accessToken,
			ACCESS_JWT_SECRET
		) as jwt.JwtPayload;
		// console.log(decoded)
		//
		// if there is now decoded.sub if false, throw a 403 error and indicate Invalid or expired token
		if (!decoded.sub)
			throw new Error('Invalid or expired access token.', {
				cause: { status: 403 }
			});

		// query the DB to find user by id that matches decoded.sub
		const user = await User.findById(decoded.sub).select('-password').lean();

		// throw a 404 error if no user is found
		if (!user) throw new Error('User not found', { cause: { status: 404 } });

		// send generic success message and user info in response body
		res.json({ message: 'Valid token', user });
	} catch (error) {
		// if error is an because token was expired, call next with a 401 and `ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRED' code
		if (error instanceof jwt.TokenExpiredError) {
			next(
				new Error('Expired access token', {
					cause: { status: 401, code: 'ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRED' }
				})
			);
		} else {
			// call next with a new 401 Error indicated invalid access token
			next(new Error('Invalid access token.', { cause: { status: 401 } }));
		}
	}
};
```

## Adding validation and Type safety to our current endpoints

- Now that we know out endpoint are working as intended, let's add Zod in for validation, and get some type safety

### Validate with Zod

- Since our schemas are already built, and we have our middleware, now we just need to use them in our `authRouter`

```ts
authRouter.post('/register', validateBodyZod(registerSchema), register);

authRouter.post('/login', validateBodyZod(loginSchema), login);
```

### Adding type safety to our controllers

- Import z and schemas to infer types for our DTOs, and add a type for our generic success responses

```ts
import type { z } from 'zod/v4';
import type { registerSchema, loginSchema } from '#schemas';

type RegisterDTO = z.infer<typeof registerSchema>;
type LoginDTO = z.infer<typeof loginSchema>;
type SuccessResBody = {
	message: string;
};
type TokenResBody = SuccessResBody & {
	accessToken: string;
	refreshToken: string;
};
```

- register

```ts
export const register: RequestHandler<{}, TokenResBody, RegisterDTO> = async (
	req,
	res
) => {};
```

- We can also create create a type for our user creation
  - To make clear the separation from runtime validation and type safety checks, I've refactored this to only use Zod schemas for things we are using Zod for runtime validation, and TS's utilities for type checks

```ts
type UserDTO = Omit<RegisterDTO, 'confirmPassword'>;

const user = await User.create({
	firstName,
	lastName,
	email,
	password: hashedPW
} satisfies UserDTO);
```

- login

```ts
export const login: RequestHandler<{}, TokenResBody, LoginDTO> = async (
	req,
	res
) => {};
```

- me
- Make a type for the user profile

```ts
type UserProfile = Omit<UserDTO, 'password'> & {
	_id: InstanceType<typeof Types.ObjectId>;
	roles: string[];
	createdAt: Date;
	__v: number;
};
```

- Union type for the response body

```ts
type MeResBody = SuccessResBody & { user: UserProfile };
export const me: RequestHandler<{}, MeResBody> = async (req, res, next) => {};
```

## Let's move over to the Travel Journal API to look at how we can implement the `authenticate` middleware

- Currently anyone can create a post, and anyone can edit any post (demo it)
  - Currently we're copy/pasting the author, but when we connect this to a frontend, that will come from the user profile

- In order for populate to work, we need to make the author a Object Id and we need to make a User model. It's our job to make sure the User model here matches the one in our Auth Server. The only change we'll make is to not select the password
- Post

```ts
import { model, Schema } from 'mongoose';

const postSchema = new Schema(
	{
		title: { type: String, required: [true, 'Title is required'] },
		author: {
			type: Schema.Types.ObjectId,
			required: [true, 'Author is required'],
			ref: 'User'
		},
		image: { type: String, required: [true, 'Cover image is required'] },
		content: { type: String, required: [true, 'Body is required'] }
	},
	{
		timestamps: true
	}
);

export default model('Post', postSchema);
```

- User

```ts
import { Schema, model } from 'mongoose';

const userSchema = new Schema(
	{
		firstName: { type: String, required: [true, 'First name is required'] },
		lastName: { type: String, required: [true, 'Last name is required'] },
		email: {
			type: String,
			required: true,
			unique: true
		},
		password: {
			type: String,
			required: true,
			select: false
		},
		roles: {
			type: [String],
			default: ['user']
		}
	},
	{
		timestamps: { createdAt: true, updatedAt: false }
	}
);

const User = model('User', userSchema);

export default User;
```

- We need to update our `errorHandler` to also handle expired tokens

```ts
import type { ErrorRequestHandler } from 'express';

type ErrorPayload = {
	message: string;
	code?: string;
};

const errorHandler: ErrorRequestHandler = (err, _req, res, _next) => {
	process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production' && console.error(err.stack);
	if (err instanceof Error) {
		const payload: ErrorPayload = { message: err.message };
		if (err.cause) {
			const cause = err.cause as { status: number; code?: string };
			if (cause.code === 'ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRED')
				res.setHeader(
					'WWW-Authenticate',
					'Bearer error="token_expired", error_description="The access token expired"'
				);
			res.status(cause.status ?? 500).json(payload);
			return;
		}
		res.status(500).json(payload);
		return;
	}
	res.status(500).json({ message: 'Internal server error' });
	return;
};

export default errorHandler;
```

### Authenticate middleware

- We'll need to install cookie-parser and jsonwebtoken
  - `npm i  jsonwebtoken`
- And their types packages for dev (we can also delete dotenv)
  - `npm i -D  @types/jsonwebtoken`

- import our type and jwt

```ts
import type { RequestHandler } from 'express';
import jwt from 'jsonwebtoken';
```

- Since we don't have the config setup here, we import and validate the key. It must match the secret key from the auth server

```
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://dbUser:verysecurepassword@express.93nc620.mongodb.net/
ACCESS_JWT_SECRET=ce8dbacbb0459ba342690a48332595592e34203c1aa7c676faac43853ccac642
```

- Validate env secret

```ts
const secret = process.env.ACCESS_JWT_SECRET;
if (!secret) {
	console.log('Missing access token secret');
	process.exit(1);
}
```

- Then we make our classic middleware signature
  - adding `_` is a convention to indicate that we won't be using this parameter

```ts
const authenticate: RequestHandler = (req, _res, next) => {};

export default authenticate;
```

- re-export

- The beginning of this is going to look just like our `me` endpoint
- We check for the accessToken and throw an error if it's not there

```ts
const authHeader = req.header('authorization');
const accessToken = authHeader && authHeader.split(' ')[1];

if (!accessToken)
	throw new Error('Not authenticated', { cause: { status: 401 } });
```

- in a try/catch block we try to decode the token, and handle errors in the same way

```ts
try {
	const decoded = jwt.verify(accessToken, secret) as jwt.JwtPayload;
	// console.log(decoded)
	//
	// if there is now decoded.sub if false, throw a 403 error and indicate Invalid or expired token
	if (!decoded.sub)
		throw new Error('Invalid or expired access token.', {
			cause: { status: 403 }
		});
} catch (error) {
	// if error is an because token was expired, call next with a 401 and `ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRED' code
	if (error instanceof jwt.TokenExpiredError) {
		next(
			new Error('Expired access token', {
				cause: { status: 401, code: 'ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRED' }
			})
		);
	} else {
		// call next with a new 401 Error indicated invalid access token
		next(new Error('Invalid access token.', { cause: { status: 401 } }));
	}
}
```

- We store the userId and user roles that came from the token, and add them to the request object and call `next()`

```ts
const user = {
	id: decoded.sub,
	roles: decoded.roles
};
req.user = user;

next();
```

- Add the type so TS is happy

```ts
namespace Express {
	interface Request {
		user?: {
			id: string;
			roles: string[];
		};
	}
}
```

- We add it to protected endpoints

```ts
import { authenticate } from '#middlewares';

const postsRouter = Router();

postsRouter
	.route('/')
	.get(getAllPosts)
	.post(authenticate, validateZod(postSchema), createPost);

postsRouter
	.route('/:id')
	.get(getSinglePost)
	.put(authenticate, validateZod(postSchema), updatePost)
	.delete(authenticate, deletePost);

export default postsRouter;
```

- Now when you are signed in you can make a new post. Currently any signed in user can edit or delete anyone's post, but we'll fix that later

## Now for logging out

- We will need to clear the access token from local storage on the client, but we will need to delete th refresh token from our DB
- To follow conventions, this will be a POST request, and we will add the refresh token to the body of the request. That means we'll need a zod schema

```ts
export const refreshTokenSchema = z.object({
	refreshToken: z.string().min(1)
});
```

- add validation to our endpoint

```ts
authRouter.post('/logout', validateBodyZod(refreshTokenSchema), logout);
```

- Make a DTO type

```ts

```

- Access token from body, and delete it from our DB

```ts
export const logout: RequestHandler<
	{},
	SuccessResBody,
	RefreshTokenDTO
> = async (req, res) => {
	// get refreshToken from request cookies
	const { refreshToken } = req.body;

	// if there is a refreshToken cookie, delete corresponding RefreshToken from the DB
	if (refreshToken) await RefreshToken.deleteOne({ token: refreshToken });

	// send generic success message in response body
	res.json({ message: 'Successfully logged out' });
};
```

## And finally our refresh endpoint

- We'll do some fancy stuff on the frontend so that any time our access token is expired, we'll automatically hit this endpoint to generate new tokens

- add zod body validation to endpoint

```ts
authRouter.post('/refresh', validateBodyZod(refreshTokenSchema), refresh);
```

- Make our controller

```ts
export const refresh: RequestHandler<{}, TokenResBody> = async (req, res) => {
	// get refreshToken from request cookies
	const { refreshToken } = req.cookies;

	// if there is no refresh token throw a 401 error with an appropriate message
	if (!refreshToken)
		throw new Error('Refresh token is required.', { cause: { status: 401 } });

	// query the DB for a RefreshToken that has a token property that matches the refreshToken
	const storedToken = await RefreshToken.findOne({
		token: refreshToken
	}).lean();

	// if no storedToken is found, throw a 403 error with an appropriate message
	if (!storedToken) {
		throw new Error('Refresh token not found.', { cause: { status: 403 } });
	}

	// delete the storedToken from the DB
	await RefreshToken.findByIdAndDelete(storedToken._id);

	// query the DB for the user with _id that matches the userId of the storedToken
	const user = await User.findById(storedToken.userId).lean();

	// if not user is found, throw a 403 error
	if (!user) {
		throw new Error('User not found.', { cause: { status: 403 } });
	}

	// create new tokens with util function
	const [newRefreshToken, newAccessToken] = await createTokens(user);

	// set auth cookies with util function
	// setAuthCookies(res, newRefreshToken, newAccessToken);

	// send generic success response in body of response
	res.json({
		message: 'Refreshed',
		refreshToken: newRefreshToken,
		accessToken: newAccessToken
	});
};
```

# Authorization

- We've done most of the heavy lifting already. Now that we have authentication in place, we can authorize with an if statement (and maybe get fancy with a middleware)
- We've protected our POST, PUT, and DELETE endpoints for posts, but currently if a user is logged in, they have edit access to any post, whether or not they are the author (demo)
- In our `authenticate` middleware, we are adding a `user` property to the Request object that includes the user's id and roles. We can use that to authorize a user

## ABAC

- We'll start with allowing only the author of a post to edit it
- First we need to destructure the `user` property

```ts
const {
	params: { id },
	user
} = req;
```

- We then need to check if the `user.id` is equal to the `author` property (as a string). So we'll break up our update into 2 steps:
  - Find post
  - Update and save if authorized
- Query the DB for the post

```ts
const post = await Post.findById(id);

if (!post)
	throw new Error(`Post with id of ${id} doesn't exist`, {
		cause: { status: 404 }
	});
```

- Throw an error if id's don't match

```ts
if (user?.id !== post.author.toString()) {
	throw new Error('Not authorized', { cause: { status: 403 } });
}
```

- Save and populate

```ts
const {
	params: { id },
	body: { title, content, image },
	user
} = req;

post.title = title;
post.content = content;
post.image = image;

await post.save();

await post.populate('author');

res.json(post);
```

## RBAC

- We can also easily implement RBAC by checking if the user's roles include 'admin'

```ts
if (user?.id !== post.author.toString() && !user?.roles.includes('admin')) {
	throw new Error('Not authorized', { cause: { status: 403 } });
}
```

### delete

- We can then do the same to protect the delete endpoint

```ts
export const deletePost: RequestHandler = async (req, res) => {
	const {
		params: { id },
		user
	} = req;
	if (!isValidObjectId(id))
		throw new Error('Invalid id', { cause: { status: 400 } });

	const post = await Post.findById(id);

	if (!post)
		throw new Error(`Post with id of ${id} doesn't exist`, {
			cause: { status: 404 }
		});

	if (user?.id !== post.author.toString() && !user?.roles.includes('admin')) {
		throw new Error('Not authorized', { cause: { status: 403 } });
	}
	await Post.findByIdAndDelete(id);

	res.json({ success: `Post with id of ${id} was deleted` });
};
```

## Implementing a middleware

- This solution works, but it's not very scalable. If we were to introduce more roles (such as staff, partner, etc) and more resources, we'd have to copy/paste this kind of logic into all of them. Which makes this a great use case for implementing a middleware

### hasRole

- Similar to our body validation, we'll create a middleware factory so we can pass arguments, saying which roles are allowed to do this operation

```ts
import type { RequestHandler } from 'express';

const hasRole = (): RequestHandler => {
	return (req, _res, next) => {
		next();
	};
};

export default hasRole;
```

- We want `hasRole` to take one or more arguments, to define which roles are allowed to do this operations, for example
  - We'll use the `self` role to indicate an author should be able to edit

```ts
hasRole('user', 'staff', 'self');
```

- To give us flexibility in the number of parameters we use, we can use (rest parameters)[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/rest_parameters]. These will get passed as an array of strings

```ts
const hasRole = (...roles: string[]): RequestHandler => {
	return (req, _res, next) => {
		next();
	};
};
```

- We should only use `hasRole` if the request has been through the `authenticate` middleware and has added the `user` property, so simply call next with an error right away, and do an early return if it's not there

```ts
if (!req.user)
	return next(new Error('Unauthorized', { cause: { status: 401 } }));
```

- We'll need the `id` from params, and to access the roles and id from the `req.user`
  - Since those names are taken, we can give aliases when destructuring

```ts
const { id } = req.params;
const { roles: userRoles, id: userId } = req.user;
```

- If the user is an admin, we can call next right away, since they are authorized to do everything

```ts
if (userRoles.includes('admin')) {
	return next();
}
```

- We can import the middleware and use it now on edit and delete (we could include `admin` for clarity's sake, but it's not necessary since admin automatically passes)

```ts
postsRouter
	.route('/:id')
	.get(getSinglePost)
	.put(authenticate, hasRole('self'), validateZod(postSchema), updatePost)
	.delete(authenticate, hasRole('self'), deletePost);
```

- We can also specify that only `users` can post

```ts
postsRouter
	.route('/')
	.get(getAllPosts)
	.post(authenticate, hasRole('user'), validateZod(postSchema), createPost);
```

- If we test our endpoint as an admin, we see that it works!

- We are using the `self` role to allow authors to edit/delete their own posts, which means we'll have to query for the post to check for the author (so we'll also have to make the function async)
- Since we only want to query the DB if we have something to query, we check for if we have an id to query with
  - test as `self`

```ts
import { Post } from '#models';
// other stuff...
const { id } = req.params;

let post: InstanceType<typeof Post> | null = null;

if (id) {
	post = await Post.findById(id);

	if (!post)
		return next(new Error('Post not found', { cause: { status: 404 } }));
	req.post = post;
}

if (userRoles.includes('admin')) {
	return next();
}

if (roles.includes('self')) {
	if (post?.author.toString() !== userId) {
		return next(new Error('Forbidden', { cause: { status: 403 } }));
	}

	return next();
}
```

#### Removing redundant DB query

- But now we're querying the DB for the post twice. Probably not a huge deal, if we can avoid this redundant call, we should
- Instead of only querying when role includes self, we can always do it, and add the post to the request body

```ts
const { id } = req.params;
const { roles: userRoles, id: userId } = req.user;

const post = await Post.findById(id);

if (!post) return next(new Error('Post not found', { cause: { status: 404 } }));
req.post = post;
```

- We add it to our `index.d.ts` file. We can use a TS Utility helper called `InstanceType` to derive the type we get from our Post
  - We can't use Zod our a DTO type here, since we need to include all of the methods

```ts
import type { Post } from '#models';
namespace Express {
	interface Request {
		user?: {
			id: string;
			roles: string[];
		};
		post?: InstanceType<typeof Post>;
	}
}
```

- Back in our controllers, we can destructure this new property instead of querying again.
  - We'll still throw an error if no post property is there
  - We can remove our check here if the id's match

```ts
export const updatePost: RequestHandler = async (req, res) => {
	const {
		params: { id },
		body: { title, content, image },
		post
	} = req;

	if (!post)
		throw new Error(`Post with id of ${id} doesn't exist`, {
			cause: { status: 404 }
		});

	post.title = title;
	post.content = content;
	post.image = image;

	await post.save();

	await post.populate('author');

	res.json(post);
};
```

- And the same for delete

```ts
export const deletePost: RequestHandler = async (req, res) => {
	const {
		params: { id },
		post
	} = req;

	if (!post)
		throw new Error(`Post with id of ${id} doesn't exist`, {
			cause: { status: 404 }
		});

	await Post.findByIdAndDelete(id);

	res.json({ success: `Post with id of ${id} was deleted` });
};
```

- Since we only have `user`, `admin`, or `self` roles then we're done. If we wanted to add more roles, (i.e `read/write` etc) we could add some logic checks for those

- If you manage to finish the authorization features, go back and add type safety to each of the controllers
